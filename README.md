# Quiz: Do you know me?

## Tech stack:

A CLI app made with Javascript using Replit IDE.

## About:

The project was made as a part of Level Zero of [neogcamp](https://neog.camp/). A quiz for friends to see how well do they know me, with 6 questions and at the end their final scores and the high scores are given. I have also added functionality such that if user breaks a high score the high scores shown are updated. Used 'chalk' package for better visuals.
